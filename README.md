# Gratheory
Gratheory - a lightweight Processing 3 app for visualizing graph theory algorithms.

Supported algorithms as of right now:
  - Breadth First traversal
  - Depth First search
  - Hamiltonian Circuit traversal (An exponential solution as this problem is still currently NP-Complete)
  
Soon to support:
  - Dijkstra's algorithm
  - Planar determinability (Using Kuratowski's Theorem)
  - Possibly Euler Cycle/Path determinability
